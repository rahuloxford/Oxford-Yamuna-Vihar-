		<p>Generating random <b>paragraphs can be an excellent</b> way <i>for writers to get their creative flow</i> going at the beginning of the day. <strong>The writer has no idea</strong> what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. <em>This forces the writer</em> to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. <mark>The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it.</mark> A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their <small>writing.</small>

It's greatly beneficial for us to know the different ways this tool is being used so we can improve it with updates.
